      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into subtasks covering repository creation, virtual environment setup, directory structure creation, and documentation setup. For each subtask, include specific commands or steps needed to complete it.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with clear, well-defined steps. While not technically complex, it requires attention to detail in setting up the environment correctly. The four main components (repo setup, virtual env, directory structure, documentation) make natural subtask divisions."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema implementation into subtasks covering schema design, SQL creation script development, Python initialization script, and schema documentation. For each subtask, specify the detailed requirements and validation criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires database design expertise and understanding of relationships between multiple tables. The complexity comes from ensuring proper foreign key relationships, indexes, and efficient query design. Schema documentation and visualization add additional complexity."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data ingestion module development into subtasks covering base class design, implementation for each data source type, validation logic, error handling, and testing. For each subtask, specify the input/output requirements and edge cases to handle.",
      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity due to handling multiple data sources, data validation, transformation logic, and error handling. The need to handle both initial and incremental loads adds complexity. The variety of potential data issues requires robust validation logic."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data retrieval tool functions implementation into subtasks covering performance data functions, target data functions, historical/trend functions, and utility calculation functions. For each subtask, specify the SQL query patterns and return data structures.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires writing optimized SQL queries and designing appropriate function interfaces. The complexity comes from ensuring the queries are efficient and the returned data structures are appropriate for the agents. Each function needs proper parameter validation and error handling."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the monitoring agent implementation into subtasks covering agent configuration, data querying logic, comparison algorithms, deviation detection, and alert generation. For each subtask, specify the expected inputs/outputs and integration points.",
      "reasoning": "This task introduces significant complexity with AutoGen framework integration and implementing sophisticated monitoring logic. The agent needs to perform multi-step reasoning: querying data, comparing against targets, calculating trends, and generating structured alerts. The correlation of segment performance with projects adds additional complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user proxy agent and Streamlit UI implementation into subtasks covering proxy agent setup, dashboard layout design, data visualization components, and agent-UI communication flow. For each subtask, specify the technical approach and user experience considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines AutoGen agent implementation with Streamlit UI development, creating complexity in the integration points. The UI requires multiple components (KPI cards, tables, charts) and the communication flow between UI and agents needs careful design. Session state management adds additional complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the sophisticated recommendation logic required. The agent needs to analyze alert context, apply rule-based reasoning, and generate actionable recommendations. Integration with the monitoring agent and explaining recommendation reasoning add complexity."
